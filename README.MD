First of all, I want to note that I do not own this script. You can download this script for Maya on the website "highend3d", but since this resource is often unavailable, I decided to share this script on GitHub, where you can get it for free. ZenTools has been successfully tested on Maya 2022, 2023, 2024. Instructions on how to install and solve possible problems are in the attached file.

If you are new to GitHub, you can download the script by clicking on (<> Code).
